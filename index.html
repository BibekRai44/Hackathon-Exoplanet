        <h1 style="color:white;">Mass, Size &#38; Density </h1>

        <p style="color:white;">Our planet, Neozoi-151 has several unique characteristics that set it apart from Earth
            and makes it an intriguing celestial body.
            With a mass of approximately 9.85* 1024 kg, the planet is 1.7 times heavier than Earth.
            It has a radius of 8,657 kilometers, which is approximately 1.35 times the Earth’s radius.
            The planet boasts a density of 3.623 grams per cubic centimeter, significantly denser than our home planet.
            This high density suggests that it likely has a substantial core of heavy elements, making it distinct in
            terms of its internal composition.</p>

        <h1 style="color:white;">Gravity</h1>

        <p style="color:white;">Gravity on this planet is measured at 8.82 meters per second squared (m/s^2), which is
            approximately 0.9 times the gravity on Earth.
            This slightly weaker gravity would have implications for the planet's atmosphere, allowing it to potentially
            retain gases that might escape a planet with higher gravity.</p>

        <h1 style="color:white;">Distance from Earth and its Star</h1>
        <p style="color:white;">The planet orbits its star at a distance of 0.9 astronomical units (AU) which lies in
            the habitable zone of the star. The planet is located at a staggering distance of 561.57 light years from
            Earth, making it an exoplanet beyond our reach for direct exploration.</p>

        <h1 style="color:white;">Climate and Air Composition</h1>
        <p style="color:white;">In terms of its climate, the planet experiences a very cold temperature range, varying
            from -10°C to 10°C. This range suggests a climate that might support liquid water, a crucial ingredient for
            the potential development of life as we know it. Moreover, the air of this planet is composed 19% of oxygen,
            further the presence of 1.3 times Earth's greenhouse gases hints at a potential greenhouse effect, which
            could further impact the planet's climate.</p>

        <h1 style="color:white;">Rotation and Revolution</h1>
        <p style="color:white;">The planet rotates relatively slowly with a rotation period of 36 Earth hours, while its
            revolution period around its star is 336 earth days or approximately 0.9208 Earth years. This means that a
            day on this planet is much longer than on Earth, potentially affecting its weather patterns and day-night
            cycles.</p>

        <h1 style="color:white;">Reflection of Light of the Star</h1>
        <p style="color:white;">With an albedo of 0.26, the planet reflects a moderate amount of its star’s light, which
            could influence its overall temperature distribution and climate.</p>

        <p style="color:white;  ">NeoZoi-151 is featuring an expanse of uninterrupted ocean that extends as far
            as the eye can see.
            Its complex geography encompasses deep trenches, undersea mountain ranges, and active volcanoes
            releasing heat and minerals into the water.
            Massive icebergs drift in its colder regions, while powerful ocean currents circulate across the
            surface, distributing heat and nutrients.
            This planet's marine life is a spectacle of bioluminescent organisms and floating microbial mats,
            each adapted to the unique aquatic environment.
            Stormy skies and an array of life, from microscopic plankton to colossal deep-sea creatures,
            contribute to the intrigue of NeoZoi-151's extraordinary geography, making it a captivating subject
            for scientific exploration and discovery.

            <P style="color:white;">
                NeoZoi-151 hosts a distinctive temperate climate, maintaining a stable average temperature of
                approximately 19°C across its vast aquatic expanse. This consistent temperature is a result of the
                planet's strategic position within the habitable zone of its host star, reinforced by the thermal
                buffering of its extensive ocean. The planet's thick, water-rich atmosphere and powerful oceanic
                currents collaborate to distribute heat evenly, preventing extreme temperature fluctuations.
                Frequent
                cloud cover moderates incoming starlight and maintains a perpetually overcast sky, while a
                continuous
                hydrological cycle ensures a gentle, near-constant rainfall. These factors, combined with subtle
                variations influenced by axial tilt and orbital characteristics, shape a mild yet stable climate
                ideally
                suited for a diverse range of marine life forms adapted to these constant conditions.</P>
